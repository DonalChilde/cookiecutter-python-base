Much to do.

## Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate a Python package project

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/DonalChilde/cookiecutter-python-base.git

#With a specific output directory
cookiecutter -o ~/projects/tmp/ https://github.com/DonalChilde/cookiecutter-python-base.git

#With a specific output directory and default values from cookiecutter.json
cookiecutter --no-input -o ~/projects/tmp/ https://github.com/DonalChilde/cookiecutter-python-base.git
```
